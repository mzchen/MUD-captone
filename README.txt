This is a text based game for my Capstone project. It has no storyline,
and revolves around a player who explores a floating island and
encounters various odd foes.

PROJECT TITLE: Capstone Project
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: To create a game based on text
VERSION or DATE: 1.3.4, finished on 4/24/15
DEPENDENCIES: None	
AUTHORS: Michael Chen
USER INSTRUCTIONS: Run the main method on GameViewer

In this project, I mostly learned about referencing and dependencies. Most of my research
was on errors that I was encountering (e.g. Static, nullPointer, etc.). I also learned
a decent amount on the continuation of a method and the correct order of updating. However,
lots of the updating and continuation of the game was pretty inefficient. Most of the reason
this is such a bland game was the lack of time I had to work on it, or just my inefficiency.
If given time, I probably would've done:
A storyline
A randomized map
Included the player's name
Made a variety of classes
Made a variety of weapons
Made a variety of classes of weapons
Made a defensive system
Made a damage system
Made a variety of Monster classes
Made a monster defense system
Made a monster offensive system
Made a sneak system
Added a larger variety of actions possible
Added a Map to look at
Added an experience system
Made a visual experience
